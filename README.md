# Secure-Desktop-Infrastructure.
Creating users in Cloud assigning them roles and deploying Virtual desktop. Users need to access their virtual desktop according to there membership.
**#Description.**
This project is to track my learning progress of Cloud and Devops.
I'm trying to build a Infrastucture for our dummy company. In my companies there are 100 members. 25 members are in HR department, 25 members in Client management and rest 50 are in development.
I'll create identities for the employees in any of the Cloud (Free tier) AWS, Azure or GCP.I'll be createing IAM roles for the users based on their roles they'll be using Virtual desktops.
Deploying Virtual machines in the cloud using terraform and scaling those machines. Configuring VM's in such a way that HR team could only access HR tools and development team could only access development tools,if they try to access other portal an error would pop up.
As this is my first project any suggestions and collab is appreciated.
